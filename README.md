# 2020-NYPD-Analysis

This is a new side project I will be working on over the Summer to prove racial discrimination in the NYPD and uncover any underlying statictical biases. 

## Data 
The dataset used for this analysis if the NYC Stop Frisk data. The dataset spans from 2015-2019.

### Additional Info
Since the model will be used to analyze from 2015 - 2019, it is not robust. Take into account different factors that could contribute!
